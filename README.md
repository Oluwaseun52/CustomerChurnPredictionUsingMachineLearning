## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
ConnectTel Telecom Company is confronted with the critical challenge of customer churn, impacting business sustainability and growth. Current customer retention strategies have proven ineffective, leading to the loss of valuable customers to competitors.

## MY ROLE:
I was contacted to build a machine learning model that will predict customer churn. Leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques on available customer data, the goal is to accurately forecast customer churn, allowing for targeted retention initiatives.

## OBJECTIVES:
- Develop a robust customer churn prediction system.
- Enhance customer loyalty and reduce customer attrition.
- Maintain a competitive edge in the telecommunications industry.

## Models Deployed
- XGBoost Classfier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

## Analyzing the Results of the Trained Models
The models evaluated showed variations in performance metrics. The Naive Bayes model, after adjustments, demonstrated a strong ability to identify customers likely to churn (high recall) while maintaining reasonable precision. This balance aligns with the goal of predicting customer churn.

## What Metrics are Most Important for the Problem? Should the Business be More Concerned with Better Results on False Negatives or True Positives?
- In the context of predicting customer churn for CONNECTTEL, the business should prioritize better results on true positives (customers correctly identified as churners).
- Reducing false negatives (customers who churn but are not identified) is crucial because it allows the business to take proactive retention measures for at-risk customers.
- While maintaining reasonable precision is important to avoid unnecessary retention efforts, prioritizing recall (true positives) ensures that the business captures as many potential churners as possible.

Based on these considerations, the telecommunication should be more concerned with improving results on true positives (recall) to effectively address customer churn in the telecommunications industry.

## Recommendations
- Personalized Retention Strategies: Develop personalized retention strategies based on the churn prediction model's insights. Tailor offers, incentives, and communication to specific customer segments identified as at-risk of churning.
- Proactive Customer Support: Implement proactive customer support initiatives for customers with a high likelihood of churning. Identify pain points in their experience and address them promptly to improve satisfaction.
- Feedback Mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to collect customer feedback on service quality and reasons for potential churn. Use this feedback to make product and service improvements.
- Competitive Pricing and Packages: Continuously assess the competitiveness of pricing and service packages in the market. Adjust offerings to remain attractive to customers while maintaining profitability.
